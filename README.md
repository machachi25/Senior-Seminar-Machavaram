# Senior-Seminar-Machavaram

I was creating a generic schedule of when all the seminars are in the day. That means that the day would show the times and the 5 seminars during 5 time periods duirng the seminar day, and that means that some of the class rooms will be empty during this times that some are going to be there. Then, the students will be placed based on the generic schedule. More plans and thoghts to come in the near future.

Didn't do much in the coding environment. but still had to do some pseudocode on paper. The pseudocode was working on creating a broader schedule of all the seminars that will be going on during the day, as well as when and where they will occur. I have also been working on figuring out which ones were the most popular, in order to fill some of the blank spaces in the scudele, so that the popular courses will run twice. I just need some assistance with the technicality portion of this project, but a pkan is slowly starting to form, and I think I am on the rigth track, but I just need to get some help with the code portion. Will come see you for both aid in planning and the code, probably during extra help. Thanks!

I have added a bunhc of text files, that include all the things I consider essential from the raw data, suchas the seniors' names, their choices, the seminar names themeselves, and their ID, for future purposes. I also have created an arraylist called seniors, for where I will store the seniros info, such as their choices, name, etc. That part is still a work in porogress, but I feel as though I have made a decent amount of progress, as now I fell as if I can get something done in VS code, rather than keep trying to twiddle my fingers trying to think of something to try and get started. Please let me know your thoughts soon :).

I have started my work onto creating and printing out the toString for the student and their choices, as well as the presenters for each course. I edited my constructors, so that they will work better now, and that they can print sutff. But, I think I did a pretty good job today, staying a little more focused in class.

I have added a lot for readFile segments to my code, so that I can use them to make a toString method and create a line that shows the studetsn and their choices. Once, thsi part starts to work, then I can work on the optimization part of the project and make the schedule.

I have made some changes to the plan, and with you help, I learned to parse certain aspects of the code, and now am going to select what I need from each colum of the raw data and apply it to all students. Then will use a toString to print out the selected data in a more legible way.
